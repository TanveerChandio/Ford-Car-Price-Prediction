# ðŸš— Ford Car Price Prediction

This project applies **Linear Regression** to predict the price of used Ford cars based on features such as model, year, mileage, fuel type, and transmission.

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Feature engineering with **One-Hot Encoding** and **Label Encoding**
- Model building with Linear Regression
- Evaluating model with r2 and adjusted r2

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack
- Python (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn)
- Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- Jupyter Notebook

## ðŸ“Š Workflow
1. Import and clean dataset (`ford.csv`)
2. Perform EDA to understand data patterns
3. Apply encoding techniques for categorical features
4. Train and test ML models
5. Evaluate performance and compare results
